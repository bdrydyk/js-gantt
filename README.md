## HowTo: Usage

There are several ways on how to use the js-gantt library within your project:
- as native JavaScript library
- as [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plug-in
- as [requireJs](http://requirejs.org/) dependency

In the following the different scenarios are introduced and examples are given.

An example project using js-gantt as requireJs dependency can be found [here](https://github.com/pmeisen/dis-timeintervaldataanalyzer-ui).

## Next steps
- adding swim-lanes to the visualization
- optimize internally used index-structure (increase scrolling performance if > 100 elements are visible)

## Additional license information
Even if js-gantt is distributed under the MIT license, it should be considered, that the project
depends on other libraries (e.g. jQuery). Thus, the dependencies of the other libraries have to
be considered. A list of all dependencies can be found in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.
